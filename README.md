# Interactionmaps

This is a small but handy program (Windows Forms) to make an interactive map with markers and labels.
You need to build this project of course, but no other requirements to use it.
<br><br>
I made this for a game, to mark interesting spots on the city map I'm playing in.
It's not in a very modern style, it's just to practice my coding and I think it could be handy for other people so I share it.
If I have time and ideas, this project will get updates. But I will respond for bug fixes for sure.

# Features
- Set and remove markers with just one click on the map.
- Set and remove labels to markers with a click on them.
- Markers have groups with different colors and names.
- Make marker groups visible or hidden on the map.
- On loading a map, new groups will be recognized and added to the given defaults.

- Code cleanup for methods in MapMarker.
- Zoom in or out of the map.
- Add and remove groups at runtime.
